          a) Users must use any money in their Account within 365 days. CAPITAL
          RUSH shall have the right to directly forfeit any such unused amount
          after 365 (three hundred and sixty-five) days with effect from 01
          April 2023 (“Effective Date”) in accordance with the below-mentioned
          terms. CAPITAL RUSH does not permit any cash withdrawal against any
          idle balance lying in any user’s CAPITAL RUSH account except in
          accordance with applicable law.
          <br />
          b) Account Maintenance Fees (“Maintenance Fees”)
          <br />
          As on the Effective Date, if a User’s Account is lying dormant for a
          period of 365 days, CAPITAL RUSH shall charge an Account Maintenance
          Fee to such User which shall be computed as follows.
          <br />
          i) For Deposit Account: The entire amount lying in the Deposit Account
          which shall be inclusive of any indirect taxes.
          <br />
          ii) For Winnings Account: CAPITAL RUSH will charge an upfront freezing
          fee (“Upfront Fee”) of INR X for all inactive accounts. X will be
          equal to the amount lying in the Winnings wallet of such inactive
          account subject to a maximum cap of INR 100. Amount X shall be
          inclusive of all taxes.
          <br />
          The Maintenance Fee is for defraying the technical costs involved in
          such freezing, holding any amounts in escrow for users, etc and
          CAPITAL RUSH shall not be required to provide any warning before
          charging the Account Maintenance Fees. CAPITAL RUSH shall however
          issue a tax invoice to the User while charging the Account Maintenance
          Fees to such User.
          <br />
          In case, the User’s Account continues to be dormant beyond a period of
          365 days, CAPITAL RUSH also reserves the right to charge monthly
          maintenance fees (“Monthly Maintenance Fee”) which shall be charged on
          the balance remaining in the Winnings Account of the User after
          deduction of the Upfront Fee (“Balance”). The Monthly Maintenance Fee
          shall be charged in monthly arrears starting 30 (thirty) days after
          the Capital Rush of 365 (three hundred and sixty-five) days of
          dormancy. The Monthly maintenance fee shall be equal to 8.33% of the
          Balance and shall be inclusive of all taxes. The User shall not be
          given any warning before the charge of the Monthly Maintenance Fee.
          CAPITAL RUSH shall however issue a tax invoice to the User while
          charging the Account Maintenance Fees to such User.
          <br />
          The User shall incur this Monthly Maintenance Fee until his / her
          account is re-verified by CAPITAL RUSH and unfrozen.
          <br />
          The User can unfreeze his / her account Capital Rush by logging in to
          his / her account and re-submitting KYC documents required by CAPITAL
          RUSH for re-verification of the account.
          <br />
          The User acknowledges and agrees that this measure is designed to
          prevent fraud/identity theft and is required to protect the User’s
          information and account. The Monthly Maintenance Fee is for defraying
          the technical and manpower costs involved in re-verification of the
          User’s account, holding amounts in escrow, etc.
          <br />
          In case, the User does not unfreeze his account before the Balance
          becomes nil, the User’s account will be permanently blocked. The User
          will no longer be able to access this account and information
          associated with this account, however, this would not prevent the User
          from creating a new account on CAPITAL RUSH by following the process
          listed in this Terms of Use.
